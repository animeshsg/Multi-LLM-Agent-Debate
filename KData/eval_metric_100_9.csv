98,Agent2,"I understand my colleague's point, but I strongly argue that the free market is not the only viable means of solving social problems. While it is true that the market can allocate resources efficiently, it can also perpetuate inequality and environmental degradation. The market may not provide the necessary incentives for individuals and businesses to invest in solutions that benefit society as a whole, particularly if those solutions are not profitable. For example, the market has not driven sufficient investment in affordable housing options, leading to a shortage of affordable housing and exacerbating housing discrimination.
