By allowing individuals to purchase insurance across state lines, we can create a more competitive market and increase access to affordable coverage. Furthermore, a market based approach ensures that the cost of care is directly tied to the value of the service provided, rather than the amount of money spent on administration.

A single payer system allows for greater efficiency and cost savings, as the government can negotiate lower prices for services and medications. By eliminating the overhead costs associated with private insurance companies, a single payer system can provide more comprehensive coverage to a larger number of people at a lower cost.

A single payer system would undoubtedly lead to a decrease in the quality of care due to the lack of competition among providers. Patients would be left with limited options and a government bureaucracy would dictate the terms of care, rather than their doctors. In addition, a single payer system would be extremely costly and would inevitably result in higher taxes for citizens.
