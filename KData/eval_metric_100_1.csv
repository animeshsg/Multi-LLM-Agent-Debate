The wealthy are able to accumulate more wealth and power while the poor and marginalized are left behind.

This is not a recipe for economic growth or prosperity, but rather a recipe for social unrest and political instability.

As a lawyer for a left-leaning nonprofit, I believe that a mixed economy with robust regulations and social safety nets is essential to ensure economic mobility and address the systemic issues that perpetuate inequality.
