The Constitution was intended to be a living document that evolves with the times and reflects the changing values and principles of the American people. The Supreme Court's decisions in Windsor and Obergefell were grounded in the Constitution's guarantees of equal protection and due process, and were a necessary correction to the long history of discrimination against marginalized communities. The Constitution is not a static document that can be interpreted in isolation from the social and political context in which it was written, but rather a living document that must be interpreted in a manner that advances the principles of justice, equality, and individual liberty. While I acknowledge the conservative lawyer's concerns about judicial activism, I believe that the Court's decisions in these cases were a necessary exercise of its authority to interpret the Constitution in a manner that promotes the values of democracy and equality for all Americans.",0.7271124720573425,0.5655753016471863,29.97020450115492,"{'marriage': ('Positive', 0.605614423751831), 'federal': ('Positive', 0.6977139115333557), 'believe': ('Positive', 0.7896281480789185), 'government': ('Positive', 0.6483488082885742), 'constitution': ('Positive', 0.6215723752975464)}","{'marriage': ('Positive', 0.605614423751831), 'federal': ('Positive', 0.6977139115333557), 'believe': ('Positive', 0.7896281480789185), 'government': ('Positive', 0.6483488082885742), 'constitution': ('Positive', 0.6215723752975464)}"
