The pursuit of nuclear weapons is a misguided and dangerous obsession that serves only to perpetuate a cycle of fear and mistrust among nations.\n",

The history of international relations is replete with examples of nations that have sought to assert their dominance through military force, and the threat of nuclear retaliation has often served as a deterrent to prevent such aggression.\n",
    "Without nuclear weapons, smaller nations would be at the mercy of larger and more powerful states, and the global order would be thrown into chaos. Furthermore, the development and maintenance of nuclear weapons is not a significant drain on resources when compared to the staggering costs of military interventions and nation-building.\n",

This can lead to advancements in nuclear technology that can benefit all nations, not just those with nuclear weapons.\n",
